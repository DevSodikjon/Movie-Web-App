Yet, even within their central territories, some areas refused to bow to the Genghisids. Kozelsk was one of them.

Now, the people of Kozelsk must face a battle against the strongest army in the world, with no hope of victory. This is a story about people facing their death. Some try to escape, others are willing to do anything to survive, but most are prepared to protect their city from the relentless storms of the Mongolian hordes.",
